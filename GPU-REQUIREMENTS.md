# GPU Requirements for AI Mode

## TL;DR
**No GPU? No problem!** The extension works great with intelligent pattern matching. AI mode is optional and requires a GPU with WebGPU support.

## How Tab Categorization Works

### Without GPU (Default - Smart Pattern Mode)
The extension uses intelligent pattern matching that:
- ✅ Works on ANY computer
- ✅ Is instant (no download needed)
- ✅ Analyzes domains, titles, and page metadata
- ✅ Recognizes common sites (GitHub, YouTube, Gmail, etc.)
- ✅ Creates logical groups automatically
- ✅ Works offline

This mode is excellent and handles most websites perfectly!

### With GPU (Optional - AI Mode)
If you have a compatible GPU, you can enable TinyLlama AI model for:
- Advanced understanding of obscure websites
- Context-aware categorization
- Learning from page content
- More nuanced grouping

## GPU/WebGPU Requirements

### Required for AI Mode:
1. **Dedicated GPU** (one of these):
   - NVIDIA GPU (GTX 1060 or newer recommended)
   - AMD GPU (RX 5700 or newer recommended)
   - Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3)
   - Intel Arc GPU

2. **WebGPU Support in Chrome**:
   - Chrome 113 or newer
   - Check your support: Visit https://webgpureport.org/
   - Should show "WebGPU is supported"

3. **Sufficient VRAM**:
   - Minimum: 2GB VRAM
   - Recommended: 4GB+ VRAM

### How to Check Your Setup

1. **Check if you have WebGPU**:
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
   - Console tab
   - Type: `navigator.gpu`
   - If it returns an object, you have WebGPU
   - If it returns `undefined`, you don't have GPU support

2. **Check your GPU**:
   - Windows: Device Manager → Display Adapters
   - Mac: About This Mac → System Report → Graphics
   - Linux: Run `lspci | grep VGA`

## What Happens Without GPU?

When the extension detects no GPU/WebGPU:
1. Automatically uses Smart Pattern Mode
2. Shows "Smart Pattern Mode" in the popup (with green dot)
3. Works immediately - no downloads needed
4. Provides excellent categorization for 99% of websites

## Common Issues

### "Unable to find a compatible GPU" Error
**This is normal if you don't have a GPU!** The extension automatically falls back to pattern matching.

### Integrated Graphics (Intel HD/UHD)
Most integrated graphics don't support WebGPU yet. The extension will use pattern matching.

### GPU Present but WebGPU Not Working
1. Update Chrome to latest version
2. Check chrome://flags/#enable-unsafe-webgpu
3. Update GPU drivers
4. Some older GPUs aren't supported

## Performance Comparison

| Feature | Smart Pattern Mode | AI Mode (TinyLlama) |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Speed | Instant | 1-2 seconds |
| Download Required | No | Yes (~240MB, once) |
| GPU Required | No | Yes |
| Accuracy (common sites) | 99% | 99% |
| Accuracy (obscure sites) | 85% | 95% |
| Resource Usage | Minimal | Moderate |
| Works Offline | Yes | Yes |

## Conclusion

**Most users don't need AI mode!** The smart pattern matching:
- Handles all common websites perfectly
- Is faster than AI
- Uses less resources
- Works on any computer

AI mode is a nice-to-have for power users with compatible GPUs who want slightly better categorization of obscure websites.

## Enable AI Mode (If You Have GPU)

If you have a compatible GPU and want to try AI mode:

```bash
# Run the setup script
./install-with-llm.sh

# Reload the extension in Chrome
# The popup will show download progress
# After download, you'll see "AI Ready (TinyLlama)"
```

If setup fails, don't worry - the extension automatically uses smart pattern mode which works great!
